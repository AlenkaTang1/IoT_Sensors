# mobile_sensors

Research project on user behavior prediction based on sensor data collected in the background.

## Background and Motivation

Coming from a security point of view, a lot of sensor that are active in the mobile devices does not need user permission to access data and the purpose of this research project is to take a few sensors as a small sample running in the background while the user uses their mobile devices like normal to see how much data can be collected and we could later on find a way to protect the user's privacy.
